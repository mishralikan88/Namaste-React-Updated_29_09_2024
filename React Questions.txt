=====================================================================================================================

Missing / under-covered areas (add these)
1) React Router (very common in real projects)

Build protected routes (AuthGuard)

Nested routes + Outlet

Dynamic routes (/users/:id) + params

Search params (filter/sort via URL)

Navigation: useNavigate, Link, back button handling

Lazy route loading + Suspense fallback

2) Data fetching patterns beyond basic useEffect

Request dedupe / caching (why React Query / SWR)

Retry + exponential backoff

Pagination: cursor-based (not just page numbers)

Race condition fix (latest request wins)

Optimistic UI update (add item instantly, rollback on failure)

3) State management (senior filter)

useReducer real use case (form/todo complexity)

Context vs Redux vs Zustand — when to use what

Avoid Context re-render (split contexts, selectors pattern)

Basic Redux Toolkit slice + async thunk (even if not deep)

4) Testing (many seniors get filtered here)

Test a component with React Testing Library

Test custom hook

Mock fetch / API

Test user flows (form submit, debounce search, modal open/close)

5) Accessibility (companies care)

Keyboard nav for modal (ESC close, focus trap concept)

Proper labels, aria attributes

Button vs div click handlers (semantic HTML)

Accessible error messages in forms

6) TypeScript with React (if role expects TS)

Type props correctly (optional, union, generics)

useRef typing

Event types (ChangeEvent, FormEvent)

React.FC discussion (pros/cons)

children typing patterns

7) Rendering & SSR basics (often asked)

SSR vs CSR vs hydration (concept)

Hydration mismatch causes (common bug)

Lazy loading components + code splitting (practical)

8) Component communication edge cases

forwardRef + useImperativeHandle (common in UI libraries)

Controlled vs uncontrolled with refs (focus, reset)

Error boundaries: you have it, but add fallback UI + reset pattern

9) Styling & UI architecture (real-world)

CSS Modules vs styled-components vs Tailwind (tradeoffs)

Theming (dark mode) via context

Design system component API (Button/Input variants)
