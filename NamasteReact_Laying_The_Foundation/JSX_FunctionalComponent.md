### JSX

**Definition**: JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript. Itâ€™s used to describe what the UI should look like.

**Purpose**: JSX makes it easier to create and visualize the structure of React components, as it resembles HTML, but ultimately gets transformed into JavaScript function calls.

**Usage**: JSX is often used within React components to render elements. For example:
const element = <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;

**Transpilation**: JSX is not understood by browsers directly and needs to be transpiled into regular JavaScript using tools like Babel. The JSX code is typically transformed into React.createElement calls.




### Functional Components

**Definition**: Functional components are JavaScript functions that return JSX. They are a way to define React components using functions instead of class-based components.

**Purpose**: Functional components encapsulate the logic and presentation of UI elements and can manage state and side effects (using hooks) in modern React.

**Usage**: Functional components are defined using standard function syntax and return JSX. For example:

const Greeting = () => {
  return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
};

**Lifecycle and Hooks**: Functional components can use React hooks (like useState and useEffect) to manage state and lifecycle events, making them powerful and flexible.
